README FILE

This program takes a matlang code and converts it to a C code in C language. It consists of around 2500 lines of code.
There is a problem in the file.c file which is created at the end which is segmentation fault we get at the file.c. When we try to run the file.c file in our computers seperately, we don't get this error, however, when we try to run it in the program it gives us segmentation fault error because of a reason we don't understand due to lack of time. 

Notes for Instructor:
Me and my colleague worked very hard for this project and wrote about 2500 lines of code. We know, the assessment process of this projects are done automatically but we have to kindly ask you to view the code just for few minutes just to see how hard we studied for this code. We are writing this readme file just 30 minutes before the submission deadline and to this moment, we have gone through this code and between this midterms this is all we can do for now. Thank you for you time,
Ali Basaran
